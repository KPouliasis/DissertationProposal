\title{JCalc: A curry-Howard view of justification logic}
\author{Konstantinos Pouliasis}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
This work consists of my dissertation proposal and  it is stuctured in two parts: 
The first part is, essentially, my second examination paper with some revisions and additions. It  introduces basic elemements of my research topic which rests in 
the intersection of Justification Logic, Constructive Modality and Type Theory. I will present the relevant systems syntactically and I will pause on the basic metatheoretic
proof techniques which will be useful in the rest of the text.
In the second part I will delineate the current state of my research in the area.
I will elaborate on a modal type system that enhances simple type theory with elements of justification logic. I will present its accompanying calculus 
 obtained  a la Curry-Howard and I will argue for its computational relevance. More specifically, I will show  
that the obtained calculus characterizes  certain computational phenomena that abound in modern programming language semantics. 
I will omit full metatheoretic
results here and  I will merely hint to  proof methods that can be adopted from the first part. Finally,  I will propose certain
directions for future work. Such developments together with the omitted metatheoretic results are expected to be the study of my dissertation thesis.
This is a  paper towards the dissertation proposal partial requirement  for my Phd candidacy under the supervision of Distinguished Professor Sergei Artemov at the Department of Computer Science of the Graduate Center at City University of New York.
