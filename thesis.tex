\title{Relating Justification Logic Modality and Type Theory in Curry--Howard fashion}
\author{Konstantinos Pouliasis}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
This thesis is a work in the intersection of \ac{JL} and \ac{CHI}. Justification logic is an umbrella of modal logics of knowledge with explicit evidence. 
Justification logics have been used to tackle traditional problems in proof theory (in relation to Godel's provability), philosophy (Gettier examples, Russel's barn paradox). 
The Curry--Howard Isomorphism or \emph{proofs--as--programs} is an understanding of logic that places logical studies in conjunction with type theory and -- in current developments -- 
category theory. The point being that  understanding a system as a logic, a typed calculus and,  a language of a class of categories constitutes a useful discovery 
that can have many applications.
The application  we will be mainly concerned  is type systems for useful programming language constructs. 
This work  is structured in three parts: 
The first part (\cref{intui}, \cref{lambda}, \cref{jllogic}) is a revision of my second examination paper and constitutes 
a bird's eye view into my 
research topics:  
\emph{intuitionistic logic, justified modality} and \emph{type theory}. 
The relevant systems are introduced syntactically together with main 
 metatheoretic proof techniques which will be useful 
in the rest of the thesis.
The second part (\cref{proposal}, \cref{jcalcsem}, \cref{jcalccom}) 
features my main contributions.
I will propose  
a modal type system that extends simple type theory
 (or, isomorphically, intuitionistic propositional logic) with elements of
 justification logic and will argue about its computational significance. 
 More specifically, I will show  
that the obtained calculus characterizes  certain 
computational phenomena related to linking (module systems, foreign function implementations) 
that abound in modern programming language semantics. 
I will present full metatheoretic
results obtained for this logic/ calculus utilizing techniques from the first part 
and will provide proofs in the Appendix. The Appendix contains also information about
an implementation of our calculus in the metaprogramming framework {\sf Makam}.
Finally, I conclude this work with a small ``outro'', Chapter~\ref{ext},
where I informally show that the ideas underlying my contributions 
can be extended in interesting ways.

This work is my thesis requirement for my PhD candidacy under the supervision of Distinguished Professor Sergei Artemov at the Department of 
Computer Science of the Graduate Center, CUNY.
