This thesis would have not been possible without my supervisor Prof. Sergei Artemov.
He introduced me to the beauty of epistemic logic and its deep relations to proof theory
back at my first years as a graduate student, inspired and helped shape my topic of research. 
He has not stopped being a source of inspiration ever
since and has provided guidance, support and encouragement through our numerous meetings. 
I want to thank him deeply.

In addition, I want to thank my committee members: Prof. Fitting and Prof. Shankar. Prof. Fitting's classes
in at the graduate center have been a tremendous experience and source of knowledge wheareas,
the clarity of his both his writings and presentations helped my understand what is 
level of academic quality a young student should be striving and aiming for. Prof. Shankar has
been a great teacher and an excellent advisor. We spent hours 
discussing topics related to my thesis or to the formal methods area at large. He was one
of the people that invigorated my interest in programming language theory that has
proven very valuable for my research work and my post-doctoral career developments.

Prof. Zachos, my external committee member, has been one of the most important
chapters of academic life. It is thanks to him that I attended the Phd program at CUNY
and his guidance in all walks of my academic and non-academic life has contributed 
the most  to the successful completion of my PhD. He has been an inspiring
scientist, a great mentor and a great friend through the last fifteen years that I have 
known him.

In addition, I want to thank my wonderful friends and fellow graduate students.
