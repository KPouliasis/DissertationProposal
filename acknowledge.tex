\section*{Acknowledgements}
This thesis would have not been possible without my supervisor Prof. Sergei Artemov.
He introduced me to the beauty of epistemic logic and its deep relations to proof theory
back at my first years as a graduate student, inspired and helped shape my topic of research. 
He has not stopped being a source of inspiration ever
since and has provided guidance, support and encouragement through our numerous meetings. 
I want to thank him deeply.

In addition, I want to thank my committee members: Prof. Fitting and Prof. Shankar. Prof. Fitting's classes
in at the graduate center have been a tremendous experience and source of knowledge wheareas,
the clarity of his both his writings and presentations helped my understand what is 
level of academic quality a young student should be striving and aiming for. Prof. Shankar has
been a great teacher and an excellent advisor. We spent hours 
discussing topics related to my thesis or to the formal methods area at large. He was one
of the people that invigorated my interest in programming language theory that has
proven very valuable for my research work and my post-doctoral career developments.

Prof. Zachos, my external committee member, has been one of the most important
chapters of academic life. It is thanks to him that I attended the Phd program at CUNY
and his guidance in all walks of my academic and non-academic life has contributed 
the most  to the successful completion of my PhD. He has been an inspiring
scientist, a great mentor and a great friend and also part time roommate through the last fifteen years that I have 
known him. 

During my studies at the Graduate Center I had the chance to meet 
prominent scientists both from CUNY and worldwide. 
These people helped me expand my knowledge and improve
the quality of my work. I would like to thank explicitly Rohit Parikh, Thomas Wies,  
 Mark Tuttle and the late Kristofer Rose for inspiring classes, discussions and collaborations.
In particular, I want to give special thanks to Giuseppe Primiero who believed in this work
from early on and co-authored the first related publication with me.

In addition, I want to thank my wonderful friends both in NYC and back home as well as 
amazing fellow graduate students. I want to thank Danai Dragonea, Dafni Anesti, Antonis Bouchagiar 
and Michalis Agathos for taking care of me every summer after my teaching obligations
had turned me to a jaded new yorker. All our beautiful excursions into under the gorgeous
greek sun have helped me stay happy and healthy throughout intense academic years.
I want to thank Krystal Raydo and George Rabanca for being a family and showing me immense support
through the thick and thin in New York. 
Cagil Tasdemir has been the best person I have ever met and a great source of both knowledge and wisdom.
I want to thank fellow graduate students: Marios Georgiou,
Nikos Melissaris and Ivo Vigan for our great time inside and outside school.

Finally, I want to thank my kinfolk. Wilson Sherwin's love and understanding has been one of my
most important motivations for completing this work and looking forward to our future together.
My family Aliki, Doria, Vaso and Spyros deserve most of the credit for all my achievements including
this work. I had the luck to have two amazing sisters and two loving parents and that's all the wealth 
a man could ask for. 

This dissertation is dedicated to my late grandparents and grandaunt: 
Aliki Giannioti, a tuberculosis survivor, Theodoros (Lolos) Gianniotis, a fisherman, and
Labro Mitsiali, a factory  worker, for growing me up at their home in Anemomylos, Corfu and showing me that can build beauty with as little as
a small house, a well-kept garden painted fresh white in the spring and a tiny fish 
boat.
