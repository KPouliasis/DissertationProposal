\chapter{Curry -- Howard view of justification logic}
\label{proposal}
In this and the following chapter
we suggest reading a constructive necessity  
of a formula ($\Box A$) as  internalizing a notion 
of constructive truth of $A$ 
(a proof within a deductive system $I$) 
and validity of $A$
(a proof under an interpretation  $\llbracket A \rrbracket_J$ within some system $J$).  An example of such a relation is provided by the simply typed lambda calculus
(as $I$) 
and its implementation in $SK$ combinators (as $J$). 
We utilize justification logic to axiomatize the notion of 
validity-under-interpretation and, hence, 
treat  a  ``semantical'' notion in a purely
 proof-theoretic manner. We present the system  in 
Gentzen-style  natural deduction formulation  and provide reduction and expansion rules for the $\Box$ connective. Finally, we add proof-terms and proof-term equalities
to obtain a corresponding calculus ({\sf{Jcalc$^{-}$}}) in the next chapter.
The obtained system can be viewed as an extension of the Curry--Howard 
isomorphism with justifications.
We provide standard metatheoretic results  and suggest a 
programming language  interpretation in  languages with foreign function interfaces (\textit{FFI}s).

\section{Introduction: Necessity and Constructive Semantics}
In his seminal ``Explicit Provability and Constructive Semantics'' \cite{Artemov2001} 
Artemov developed a constructive, proof-theoretic semantics for 
\acs{BHK} proofs ~\cite{Troelstra1988} 
in what turned out to be the first development of a family of logics that we now call justification logic.
The general idea, upon which we build our calculus, is that semantics of a deductive system $I$ can be 
viewed in a solely proof-theoretic manner 
as mappings of proof constructs of $I$ into another proof system $J$ (which we call justifications).
As an example one could think  $I$  being  Heyting arithmetic and $J$ some  ``stronger'' system 
(e.g. a classical axiomatization of Peano arithmetic, a classical or intuitionistic set theory etc). 
 In Artemov's work $I$ is assumed to be
based on intuitionistic logic and $J$  on classical logic. 
We, initially,  mute such assumptions to focus exclusively on the mechanics of necessity in this framework.
We recover them later and study  their relation  to  the Rule of Necessitation for our system.
What's more,  such a semantic relation can be treated logically giving  rise to a modality of explicit necessity. 
Different sorts of necessity
($K$, $D$, $S4$, $S5$) have been offered  an explicit counterpart under the umbrella of justification logic. 
Some of them have been studied within a
Curry--Howard setting ~\cite{ArtBon07LFCS}. Our paper
focuses on  $K$ modality and  should be viewed as the  counterpart of ~\cite{Bellin2001} with justifications as we explain in \ref{relat}.
\subsection{Deductive Systems, Validity and Necessity}
Following a framework championed by Lambek \cite{Lambek1968,Lambek1969}, let us  assume two deductive systems $I$ 
(with propositional universe $U_I$, 
a possibly non-empty signature of axioms $\Sigma_I$ and an entailment relation $\Sigma_I;\Gamma\vdash_{I}A$) and $J$ 
(resp. with  $U_J$, $\Sigma_J$ and $\Sigma_J;\Delta\vdash_J \phi$). We will be using Latin letters for the formulae of $I$ and Greek letters for the formulae of $J$.
We will be omitting the $\Sigma$ signatures when they are not relevant.

For the  entailment relations of the two systems we require the following elementary principles\footnote{We are not excluding other connectives but by imposing
such minimal requirements we show that ``necessity'' ($\Box$) connective can be treated generically and orthogonally of the presence of other connectives}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Reflexivity}. In both relations $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are multisets of formulas (contexts) that enjoy reflexivity:
	$$A \in \Gamma \Longrightarrow \Gamma\vdash_{I}A$$ $$\phi \in \Delta \Longrightarrow \Delta\vdash_{J}\phi$$
	\item \textit{Compositionality}.  Both relations are closed under deduction composition:  
	$$\Gamma\vdash_I A \text{\ and\ } \Gamma^{'},A\vdash_{I} B \Longrightarrow \Gamma,\Gamma^{'}\vdash_I B $$  
	$$\Delta\vdash_J\phi \text{\ and\ } \Delta^{'},\phi\vdash_{J} \psi \Longrightarrow \Delta,\Delta^{'}\vdash_J \psi$$ 
	\item \textit{Top}. Both systems have a distinguished top formula $\top$ for which under any $\Gamma$, $\Delta$: $$\Gamma\vdash_{I}\top_I \text{\ and \ }
	\Delta \vdash_J\top_J$$
\end{enumerate}

Now we can define: 
\begin{definition}Given a deductive system $I$, an   \textit{interpretation for $I$}, noted by $\llbracket\bullet \rrbracket_J$, is a pair
	$(J,\llbracket\bullet\rrbracket)$ of a deductive  system $J$ together
	with a (functional) mapping $\llbracket \bullet \rrbracket: U_I\rightarrow U_J$ on propositions of $I$ into propositions of $J$ extended to multisets of 
	formulae of $U_I$ with the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{Top preservation}. $\llbracket\top_I \rrbracket = \top_J$
		% \item\textit{structural interpretation of connectives}. The interpretation of compound formulas built upon primitive connectives of $I$ is structural.
		% E.g. Given $Con$ is a binary primitive connective of $I$ then in prefix notation we want:  
		% $\llbracket  Con(A, B) \rrbracket_J = \llbracket\ Con\rrbracket (\llbracket A \rrbracket , \llbracket \ B \rrbracket$ where $\llbracket Con\rrbracket$ is a connective in $J$.
		\item \textit{Structural interpretation of contexts}. For  $\Gamma$ contexts of the form $A_1,\ldots, A_n$:
		$$\llbracket\Gamma \rrbracket=\llbracket A_1  \rrbracket,\ldots,  \llbracket A_n\rrbracket$$ (trivially empty contexts map to empty contexts. 
		As in \cite{Lambek1968} they can be treated as 
		the $\top$ element).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}Given a deductive system $I$  and an  interpretation $\llbracket\bullet\rrbracket_J$ for $I$ we define
	a \textit{corresponding validation of a deduction $\Sigma_I;\Gamma\vdash_I A$}  
	as a deduction $\Sigma_J;\Delta\vdash_{J} \phi$ in $J$ such that $\llbracket A \rrbracket=\phi$ and $\Delta=\llbracket \Gamma \rrbracket $ . We will be writing
	$ \llbracket \Sigma_I;\Gamma\vdash_I A\rrbracket_J$ to denote such a validation.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Given a deductive system $I$, we say that an interpretation  $\llbracket\bullet \rrbracket_J$  is \textit{logically complete} when  for
	all purely logical deductions $\mathcal{D}$ (i.e. deductions that make no use of $\Sigma_I$) in $I$ 
	there exists a corresponding (purely logical) validation $\llbracket\mathcal{D}\rrbracket$ in $J$.
	i.e. $$\forall \mathcal{D}. \ \mathcal{D}:\Gamma\vdash_I A \Longrightarrow \exists \llbracket\mathcal{D}\rrbracket: \llbracket \Gamma\vdash A\rrbracket_J$$
\end{definition}
\footnote{Note, that we require existence but not uniqueness. Nevertheless, if we treat deductive systems  in a proof irrelevant manner as preorders 
the above definition gives uniqueness vacuously. In a more refined approach where $I$ and $J$ are viewed as  categories of proofs  the above ``logical completeness''  
translates to the requirement that if the set of (purely logical) arrows $Hom_I(\Gamma,A)$ is non empty  then $Hom_J(\llbracket\Gamma\rrbracket,\llbracket A\rrbracket_J)$ 
cannot be empty (i.e. that $\llbracket\bullet \rrbracket_J$ can be extended to a functor). We leave a complete categorical semantics of our logic 
for future work but we expect   a generalization of the 
endofunctorial interpretations of $K$ modality appearing in \cite{Bellin2001,kavvos2016system}.} 


Examples of triplets ($I$, $J$, $\llbracket\bullet \rrbracket_J$) of logical systems that fall under the definition above are: any intuitionistic system mapped 
to a classical one under the embedding $\llbracket A \supset B\rrbracket= \tilde{\neg} A \tilde{\vee} B$ where  $\tilde{\neg}$
and $\tilde{\vee}$ are classical connectives, the opposite direction under double negation translation, 
an  intuitionistic system  mapped to another intuitionistic system (i.e. a mapping of atomic formulas of $I$ to atomic formulas of $J$ extended naturally to the intuitionistic connectives 
or, simply, the identity mapping) etc.  A vacuous validation  (when $\llbracket\bullet  \rrbracket_J$ maps everything to $\top$) gives another example. 

The main thesis that is exposed in this chapter is that this notion of ``double proof'' (reasoning about proofs that exists in two related systems) 
provides for an understanding of necessity in proof theoretic terms. In addition, we argue, 
that this is the driver of (at least) the simplest
form of necessity ($K$) that appears in justification logic (\textit{necessity as internalization}).
We will focus on the case where $I$ (the propositional part of our logic) is based on the implicative fragment of intuitionistic logic and show how justification logic
provides for an axiomatization of such logically complete interpretations $\llbracket\bullet\rrbracket_J$ of  implicative intuitionistic logic.
In what follows we provide  a natural deduction for
an intuitionistic system $I$ (truth), an axiomatization/specification of   $\llbracket \bullet \rrbracket_J$ (treated abstractly as a function symbol on types) and a treatment 
of basic necessity that relates the two deductions by internalizing  a  notion of ``double truth'' (proof in $I$  and  existence of corresponding validation in  $J$).
\section{Judgments of Jcalc$^{-}$}
\label{lsjcalc}

We aim for a reading of necessity that internalizes a notion of ``double proof''  in two deductive systems.
Motivated by the discussion and definitions in the previous section we will treat the notion of interpretation abstractly -- as a function symbol on types -- 
and axiomatize in accordance. Intuitively we want:
$$\Box  A\  {\sf true} :=  A\ {\sf true}\   \& \ A\ {\sf valid} = A{\sf\  true\  in\  I}\  \& \  \llbracket  A \rrbracket \ {\sf true\  in\  J}$$
We will be dropping indexes $I$, $J$ since they can be inferred by the different kinds of assumption  contexts. In addition, we  omit signatures 
$\Sigma$ since they do not offer anything from a logical perspective.

Logical entailment for the proposed  $\Box$ connective can be  summarized  easily given our previous discussion.
Given a deduction $\mathcal{D}:A \vdash B$ and  the existence of validation $\llbracket\mathcal{D}\rrbracket:\llbracket A \rrbracket\vdash \llbracket B\rrbracket$ then 
given $\Box A$ (i.e.  a proof of a  $\vdash A$ and a validation $\vdash \llbracket A \rrbracket$)
we obtain a double proof of $B$ (and hence, $\Box B$) by \textit{compositionality} of the underlying systems.  
Using standard, proof tree notation with labeled assumptions we formulate our rule of the connective in natural deduction:

\mbox{\small
	\begin{mathpar}
		\inferrule* [right=$I_{\Box B} E^{x,s}_{\Box A}$]{{\infer*{\Box  A}{}}
			\\{\inferrule*{}
				{\inferrule*[vdots=1.5em, right=$x$]{ }{ A}\\\\
					\inferrule*[]{}{ B}}}\\
			{\inferrule*{}
				{\inferrule*[vdots=1.5em, right=${s}$]{ }{\llbracket   A\rrbracket}\\\\
					\inferrule*[]{}{\llbracket  	B\rrbracket}}}
		}{\Box  B} 
		
	\end{mathpar}
}
We can, easily, generalize to $\Box$ed contexts (of the form $\Box A_1, \ldots,  \Box A_i$) of arbitrary length:

\mbox{\small
	\begin{mathpar}
		\inferrule*[right=$I_{\Box B}E^{\vec{x},\vec{s}}_{\Box A_1\ldots \Box A_i} $] {
			{\infer*{\Box A_1\ldots\Box  A_i}{}}\\	{\inferrule*{}
				{\inferrule*[vdots=1.5em, right=$\vec{x}$]{ }
				{\Gamma': A_1,\ldots  A_i}\\\\
					\inferrule*[]{}{ B}}}\\
			{\inferrule*{}
				{\inferrule*[vdots=1.5em, right=$\vec{s}$]{ }{\llbracket \Gamma'\rrbracket:\llbracket  A_1\rrbracket,\ldots \llbracket  A_i\rrbracket}\\\\
					\inferrule*[]{}{\llbracket  B\rrbracket}}}
		}{\Box  B}
		
	\end{mathpar}
}

We read as ``Introducing $\Box B$ after eliminating $\Box A_1 \ldots \Box A_i $ crossing out (vectors of) labels $\vec{x}, \vec{s}$ ". 
Interestingly, the same rule eliminates boxes  and introduces new ones. 
This  is not surprising for $K$ modality (it is a left-right rule as we will see (\ref{seqcalc}).
See also discussion in \cite{Bellin2001,Bierman2000}). We will be referring to this rule  as ``$\Box$ Intro--After--Elim'' or, simply $\Box_{IE}$, from now on.
%Moreover, it has a very clear computational reading in our system which we will be explaining. 
%In a nutshell, theorems of $K$ correspond to programs that consume (eliminate) congruences on subterms to construct construct congruences on larger terms. In that sense, the elim-intro mix is quite natural.

Note that we define the $\Box$ connective negatively, yet (pure) introduction rules for the $\Box$ 
connective are  derivable. 
Such are instances of the previous Intro--After--Elim rule when 
$\Gamma'$ is empty which conforms exactly with the idea  of necessity internalizing double theoremhood.

\mbox{
	\begin{mathpar}	
		\inferrule*[right=$I_{\Box  B}$]{{\vdash B }\\{\vdash \llbracket B \rrbracket}}{\Box B}
	\end{mathpar}}
	
	In the next section, we provide the whole calculus in natural deduction format. As expected
	we will extend the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic with 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Judgments about validity (justification logic).
		\item Judgments that relate truth and validity (modal judgments).
	\end{itemize}
	%The former judgments could be viewed as a "Hilbert-style" encoding of the underlying intuitionistic one. Justification logic uses a combinatory calculus (extended with classical combinators) to represent logical principles (constants) in this second level. We follow the same route, obtaining a Curry Howard Correspondance for Justification logic under this new ``necessity as double proof" doctrine. 
	\subsection{Natural Deduction for Jcalc$^{-}$}
	The treatment of necessity in the previous section is completely orthogonal to the underlying systems \
	(it just assumes the basic requirements stated for the behavior $\llbracket\dot\rrbracket$). 
	In this section we will provide a full natural deduction and in congruence with justification logic we will
	assume that the underlying system ($I$) is a fragment of intuitionistic logic (the `negative' to be precise).
	The host theory $J$ can still remain unspecified, but the choice of $I$ informs for some specifications ( in order to preserve
	completeness of logical deductions).   

	Following type theory conventions,  we first provide rules underlying type construction, then  rules for  well-formedness of (labeled) assumption contexts and rules  introducing and eliminating connectives. 
	The rules below should be obvious except for small caveat.
	 On the one hand, the type universe of $U_I$ and the proof trees of $I$ are 
	inductively defined as usual; on the other 
	hand, the host theory $J$ (its corresponding universe, connectives and  proof trees) is  ``black boxed''. What we actually axiomatize are the properties that all
	(logic preserving) interpretations of $I$ should conform to, independently of the specifics of the host theory. 
	Validity judgments should thus be read  as specifications
	of provability (existence of proofs) of any candidate $J$. 
	
	When we write $\llbracket \Gamma\rrbracket\vdash\llbracket\phi\rrbracket$ it reads as there exists derivation
	$\mathcal{D}$ : $\Delta\rrbracket\vdash_{J}\psi\rrbracket$ s.t. $\Delta=\llbracket\Gamma\rrbracket$ and $\psi = \llbracket \phi\rrbracket$ )
	
	We use ${\sf Prop_0}$  to denote  the type universe of $I$ and $\llbracket \sf Prop_0\rrbracket $ to denote its image under an interpretation, ${\sf Prop_1}$ denotes   modal (``boxed'') types
	and ${\sf Prop}$  the union of ${\sf Prop_0, Prop_1}$. We write $P_k$ with $k$ ranging in some subset of natural numbers to denote atomic propositions in $I$.

		}

	%From now on we will be omitting the type construction derivations and write, informally, $ A\in U$( or, for multisets, $\Gamma\in U$) denoting the unique (\ref{bftu}) such derivation(s). 
	
	
	
	
	For labeled contexts of assumptions we require standard wellformedness conditions (i.e. uniqueness of labels).
	We use letters $x_i$, or simply $x$, for labels of  contexts with assumptions in $\sf Prop_0$, $x_i'$ or simply $x'$ for contexts with assumptions in   $\sf Prop_1$ and $s_i$, or simply $s$,  
	for $\sf \llbracket Prop_0 \rrbracket$ contexts. 
	We use $\circ$ and $\Box\circ$ for the empty context of ${\sf Prop_0}$ and ${\sf Prop_1}$ respectively
	and  $\dagger$ for the empty context of ${ \llbracket {\sf Prop_0}\rrbracket}$.
	%We ``overload" the use of $\in$ symbol and write $x\not\in\Gamma$ to denote that ``the label $x$ is not present in the domain of $\Gamma$".
	We abuse notation and write $x:A\in\Gamma$ 
	(or, similarly, $s:\llbracket A\rrbracket\in\Delta$) 
	to denote that the label $x$ is assigned type $A$ in $\Gamma$; 
	or $\Gamma\in {\sf Prop_0}$ instead of $\Turn {\Gamma}{\sf wf_0}$
	(resp. $\Gamma \in {\sf Prop_1}$, $\Delta\in {\sf \llbracket Prop_0\rrbracket}$)  
	to denote that  $\Gamma$ is a wellformed context  with  co--domain of elements in ${\sf Prop_0}$ (resp. in ${\sf Prop_1}$, $\llbracket {\sf Prop_0}\rrbracket$).
	For $\Gamma \in {\sf Prop_0}$ we define  $\llbracket \Gamma\rrbracket$ as 
	 the lifting of the context $\Gamma$ through the $\llbracket \bullet \rrbracket$  symbol 
	(with appropriate renaming of variables -- e.g. $x_i\rightsquigarrow s_i$), similarily
	we define the $\Box \Gamma$ operation . 
	For the vacuous cases  when $\Gamma$  is  the empty context
	we require $\llbracket\circ \rrbracket = \dagger$  
	and $\Box \Gamma=\Box\circ$to be well formed.

		For the calculus of interpretation (validity) we demand context reflexivity, compositionality and logical completeness with respect to  intuitionistic implication.
		Logical completeness is specified axiomatically, since the host theory is ``black boxed''. 
		Following justification logic, we use an axiomatic characterization of combinatory logic (for $\supset$) together 
		with the requirement that the interpretation preserves modus ponens:

			Finally, we have judgments in the $\Box$ed universe (${\sf Prop_1}$). These are context reflection, the $\Box$ Intro-After-Elim rule, and the rules for intuitionistic implication between $\Box$ed types
			\footnote{The implication and elimination rules in ${\sf Prop_1}$ actually coincide with the ones
				in ${\sf Prop_0}$ since we are focusing on the case where $I$ is intuitionistic. This need not necessarily be the case as we have explained. Intuitionistic  implication among $\Box$ types should be read as
				``double proof of $A$ implies double
				proof of $B$'' and would still be defined even if we did not observe any kind of  implication in $I$. Similarly, one could provide intuitionistic conjunction or disjunction between $\Box$ types independently of 
				$I$ and, vice versa, one could add connectives in $I$ that are not observed between $\Box$ed types.}.

\subsection{Logical Completeness, Admissibility of Necessitation and Completeness with respect to Hilbert Axiomatization}
\label{completness}
Here we give a Hilbert  axiomatization  of the $\supset$ fragment of intuitionistic $K$ logic in order to compare it with our system. Here  $\vdash^{\mathcal{H}}$ captures the textbook (metatheoretic)
notion of ``deduction from assumptions'' in a Hilbert style axiomatization. We assume the restriction of the system to formulas up to modal degree $1$.

	It is easy to verify that axioms $1$, $2$ are derived theorems of {\sf Jcalc$^{-}$} in ${\sf Prop_0}$. The rule Modus Ponens is also admissible trivially, whereas axiom $K$  was  
	shown to be a theorem in the previous section (\ref{smpdv}). The rule of Necessitation is not obviously admissible though. In our reading of necessity the
	admissibility of this rule is directly related to the requirement of ``logical completeness of the interpretation'' i.e. preservation of logical theoremhood.  
	In general, adding more connectives in $I$ would require additional specifications for the host theory to obtain necessitation.
	
	The steps of the proof are given in the Appendix, but this is essentially  the ``lifting lemma'' in justification logic \cite{Artemov2001}. 
	The proof fully depends on
	the provability requirements imposed in the $\llbracket{\sf Prop_0}\rrbracket$ fragment.
	\begin{theorem}[$\Box$Lifting Lemma]
		In {\sf Jcalc$^{-}$}, for every  $\Gamma,   A \in {\sf Prop_0}$ if  $\Gamma\vdash A$ then  $\llbracket \Gamma\rrbracket\vdash\llbracket A\rrbracket $ and, hence, $\Box\Gamma \vdash \Box   A$.
	\end{theorem}
	We get admissibility of necessitation as a lemma for $\Gamma$ empty:
    \begin{theorem}[Admissibility of Necessitation]
		
     For $  A \in {\sf Prop_0}$, if $\circ\vdash   A$ then $\circ\vdash \Box A$. 
	\end{theorem}
	As a result:
	\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
		{\sf Jcalc$^{-}$} is complete with respect to the Hilbert style formulation of degree-$1$ intuitionistic $K$ modal logic. 
	\end{theorem}
	
	\subsection{Harmony: Local Soundness and Local Completeness}
	\label{gprinc}
	Before we move on to show (Global) Soundness we provide evidence for the so called ``local soundness" and ``local completeness'' of the $\Box$ connective
	following Gentzen's dictum. The local soundness and completeness for the $\supset$ connective 
	is given elsewhere (e.g. \cite{prawitz10natural}) and in Gentzen's original \cite{gentzen1935untersuchungen}. Gentzen's program can be described with the following two slogans:\begin{itemize} \item[a.] Elim is left-inverse to Intro \item[b.] Intro is right-inverse to Elim\end{itemize}   
	Applied to the $\Box$ connective, the first principle says that introducing a $\Box   A$ (resp. many $\Box A_1, \ldots, \Box A_i$) only to eliminate it (resp. them) directly is redundant. 
	In other words, the elimination rule cannot give you more data than what were inserted in the introduction rule(s)  (``elimination rules are not \textit{too} strong").
	We show first the ``Elim-After-Singleton-Intro" sub-case.

	These equalities are of importance since they dictate (together with the corresponding principles for the $\supset$, $\wedge$ connectives) the proof dynamics of the calculus. 
	The proof term assignment and the corresponding computational ($\beta$-)rules  are directly instructed by these reduction principles. We see that eliminating (using) an introduced $\Box$ 
	corresponds to double substitution in the corresponding judgments. 
	
	Dually, the second principle says eliminating a $\Box A$ , should give enough information to directly reintroduce it (``elimination rules are not \textit{too weak}"). This is an expansion principle.

		\subsection{(Global) Soundness}
		\label{seqcalc}
		Soundness is shown by proof theoretic techniques. Standardly, we add the bottom type ($\bot$) to {\sf Jcalc$^{-}$} together with its elimination rule and show  that the system is consistent ($\not\vdash \bot$) by   devising a sequent calculus  and showing admissibility of cut. We 
		only present the calculus here and collect the theorems towards consistency  in the Appendix. 
		
		In the following we use $\Gamma\Rightarrow   A$ (where $\Gamma,  A \in {\sf Prop_0}\cup{\sf Prop_1})$  to denote 
		sequents modulo $\Gamma$ permutations where $\Gamma$ is a multiset of ${\sf Prop}$ (no labels)  and $\Delta \Rightarrow\sf \llbracket   A \rrbracket$ for sequents corresponding to $\llbracket \sf judgments \rrbracket$ of the calculus modulo $\Delta$ permutations (with $\Delta$ (unlabeled) multiset of ${\sf \llbracket Prop_0 \rrbracket}$). The multiset/ modulo permutation approach is instructed by standard structural properties. 
		All properties are stated formally and proved in the Appendix. 
		
		The  $\llbracket\Gamma\rrbracket \Rightarrow \llbracket A \rrbracket$ relation  is defined directly from  $\vdash$:
		\begin{mdframed}[nobreak=true,frametitle={\footnotesize Sequent Calculus ($\llbracket {\sf Prop_0} \rrbracket$)}]
			$$\begin{array}{l r}

			where $\pi(\llbracket\Gamma\rrbracket)$ is the collection of  permutations of $\llbracket\Gamma\rrbracket$.

			\chapter{Order theoretic semantics}
			\label{jcalcsem}
			This chapter started by introducing 
			mappings between deductive systems and 
			motivating the reading of necessity as ``double-proof under a map''.
			As a result, it is unsuprising the the calculus is amenable to order theoretic sematics.
			We present them in this section.

			In order to progress we first define the notion of a 
			\vocab{semi-Heyting  Algebra (semi-HA)}. 
			To define semi-HA we need the notion of a \vocab{(meet) semi-lattice}.
			  
			
			\begin{mdframed}
			\textbf{Definition:}
			A \textit{(meet) semi-lattice} is a non-empty \emph{partial order} (i.e. reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive) 
			with finite meets.
			\end{mdframed}
			In addition, we define \emph{meet semi-lattice} as follows: 
			\begin{mdframed}
			\textbf{Definition:}
			A \textit{bounded (meet) semi-lattice} $(L,\le)$ is a (meet) 
			semi-lattice that additionally has 
			a \emph{greatest element} (we name it $1$), which satisfies
			
			$x \le 1$ for every $x$ in $L$
			\end{mdframed}
			Finally, we can define \emph{semi-HA}:
			
			\begin{mdframed}
			\textbf{Definition:}
			A \textit{semi-HA} is a bounded (meet) semi-lattice $(L,\le, 1)$ 
			s.t. for every $a,b\in L$ there exists an \textit{exponential} 
			(we name it $a\rightarrow b$) 
			with the properties: 
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item $a\rightarrow b\times a\le b $
			\item $a\rightarrow b$ is the greatest such element
			\end{enumerate}
			\end{mdframed}
			
			
			In addition, given two \emph{semi-HAs}, we are 
			interested in order preserving 
			functions (functors) $F$ that also preserve products and exponentials: 
			\begin{mdframed}
				\textbf{Definition}
			A function $F$ between two (semi)-HAs ($HA_1$, $HA_2$) is order preserving
			and commutes with top, products and exponentials \emph{iff} for every 
			$\phi,\psi \in HA_1$
				\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\phi\le_{HA_1}\psi\Rightarrow F\phi\le_{HA_2}F\psi$
				\item $F\top_{HA_1} = \top_{HA_2}$ 
				\item{$F(\phi \times\psi) = F(\phi)\times(F(\psi)$} 
				\item $F(\phi\rightarrow \psi) = F(\psi)\rightarrow F(\phi)$
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{mdframed}
			
			For the order theoretic models of  Jcalc $^{-}$ the following structures (triplets) 
			are of interest. We define a $Jcalc$-triplet as follows:
			\begin{mdframed}
				\textbf{Definition}
			A \emph{$Jcalc$-triplet} is 
				
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item A semi-Hayting algebra $HA$
			\item A partial order $J$
			\item An order preserving function $F$ from $HA$ to $J$ s.t.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The image $F(HA)$ forms a semi-Heyting Algebra
				\item $F$ preserves top, products and exponentials
			\end{enumerate}
			\end{enumerate}
			\end{mdframed}
			We are going to utilize the following definition: 
			\begin{mdframed}
				\textbf{Definition}
				Given two partial orders $(K,\le_{K})$, $(L,\le_{L})$ and a function ($F: K\rightarrow L$) 
				we can define the algebra of $F$-points  $(F:K \rightarrow L,\le_{F:K\rightarrow L})$
				where:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Elements of $F:K\rightarrow L$ are  pairs of the form $\langle k,Fk \rangle$
					\item $\langle k_1,Fk_1 \rangle \le_F \langle k_2, Fk_2\rangle$ \textit{iff}  $k_1\le_{K}k_2$ and $Fk_1\le_{L}Fk_2$ 
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{mdframed}

			\begin{theorem}
				For any triplet $(K, L, F)$ of $HA$s with an order 
				preserving function $F:K\rightarrow L$
				the algebra of $F$-points is a partial order.
			\end{theorem}
			\begin{proof}
				It is trivial to show that the algebra of $F$-points ``inherits'' reflexivity, 
				transitivity and antisymmetry from the underlying algebras.
			\end{proof}

			Given a $Jcalc$-triplet there is an induced $F$-point algebra:
			\begin{mdframed}
				\textbf{Definition}
				Given a $Jcalc$-triplet we define the algebra  $\Box^{F}HA$ as the induced $F$-point algebra.
			\end{mdframed}
			By the definitions, the $\Box^{F}HA$ point algebra has the following properties:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Elements are pairs $\langle A, FA\rangle$ (name them $\Box^{F}A$) where $A\in HA$ and $FA$ its image
				\item For every two elements $\Box^{F}A$, $\Box^{F}B$:

				$\Box^{F}A \le\Box^{F}B \text{ \textit{iff} } A\le_{HA}B 
				\text{ \textit{and} } FA\le_J FB $ 
				
				\item It is a Heyting algebra with:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $\Box^F\top := \langle \top_{HA}, F\top_{HA}=\top_J \rangle$ 
					\item Elements of the form $\Box^F (A \times B)$ 
					forming products (we name them $\Box^F A\times \Box^F B$)
					\item Elements of the form $\Box^F ( A\rightarrow B)$ 
					forming exponentials (name them $\Box^F{A}\rightarrow \Box^F B$)
				\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate}
			The last property is not obvious so we will sketch the proof. We will be
			omitting indexes in the $\le$ relations since they can be trivially inferred:
			\begin{theorem}[$\Box^{F}HA$ is Heyting]
			\end{theorem}
			\begin{proof}
				$\Box^F \top$ is a top element since for any $A\in HA$, 
				$A\le \top$ and thusly $FA\le F\top=\top_J$ and thus by definition
				$\Box^F A\le\Box^F\top $ for any $\Box^F A$.

				For any two elements $\Box^F A$, $\Box^F B$, 
				the element $\Box^F (A \times B)$ forms their product since,
				$A \times B\le A$ in $HA$ and $F(A\times B)=FA\times FB \le FA$
				in $J$, and thusly, 
				$\Box^F (A \times B)\le \Box^FA$ (in $\Box^F HA$).
				Analogously, $\Box^F (A \times B)\le \Box^FA$.

				In addition, $\Box^F (A \times B)$ is the product we need to show 
				that is the greatest element with the previous property.
				I.e. for any $\Box^F C$ s.t. $\Box^F C\le \Box^F A $ and 
				$\Box^F C\le \Box^F B $ we get $\Box^F C\le\Box^F(A\times B)$. 
				By the definition for any such  $\Box^F C$ we have $C\le A\times B$
				and $FC\le F(A\times B)$ which imply that $\Box^F C\le\Box^F(A\times B)$

				To show that  $\Box^F(A\rightarrow B)$ is the  
				exponential of $\Box^FA$, $\Box^FB$, 
				we have to show, first that 
				$\Box^F ( A\rightarrow B)\times\Box^F A\le \Box^F B$.
				By the $\Box^F HA$ product definition 
				$\Box^F ( A\rightarrow B)\times\Box^F A :=\Box^F( (A\rightarrow B)\times A)$. 
				Also
				by the underlying exponentials we have $ (A\rightarrow B)\times A\le B$ 
				and  $F((A\rightarrow B)\times A)= (FA\rightarrow FB)\times FA \le FB$
				which by definition of $\Box^F HA$ gives   
				$\Box^F((A\rightarrow B)\times A)\le \Box^F B$ 
				and hence, by definition, 
				$\Box^F ( A\rightarrow B)\times \Box^F A\le \Box^F B$.

				In addition we have to show that 
				$\Box^F ( A\rightarrow B)$ is the 
				greatest element with the previous property.
				Consider any other $\Box^F C$ s.t. $\Box^F C\times\Box^F A\le \Box^F B$, 
				by definitions of $\Box^F$ and its products then, $C\times A\le B$
				 and $FC\times FA\le FB$.
				  By the definitions of the underlying exponentials 
				 we get $C\le A\rightarrow B$ and 
				 $FC \le FA\rightarrow FB =F(A\rightarrow B)$. 
				 And again by definition of $\Box^F HA$, $\Box^F C\le \Box^F(A\rightarrow B)$.  
			\end{proof}


			Given a $Jcalc$-triplet we can define a $Jcalc$-algebra:
			\begin{mdframed}
				\textbf{Definition}
				Given a $J$-triplet we define the corresponding $Jcalc$ algebra as the union of the underlying relations
				of   $HA$, $F(HA)$, $\Box^{F}HA$
			\end{mdframed}
				\begin{theorem}\label{thm:cmpjtriplet}
					\textbf{Soundness and completness}\\

				and any $*$ map that extends  a map of atomic $\prop$s ($p_i$) to elements of $HA$

				is defined inductively on the length of $\Gamma$ as shown below

				  \Gamma^+\times_{\Box^{F}HA}\Box^F (\phi)*\\
				\end{alignat*}
				\end{theorem}
			\begin{proof}
				To prove soundness we go by induction on the derivations. 
				For the ${\sf Prop_0}$ fragment
				the proof is well-known from intutionistic logic semantics ($\Gamma\in{\sf Prop_0}\vdash \phi\in {\sf Prop_0}
				\Rightarrow \Gamma^+\le_{HA}\phi *$)
				. 
				For the ${\sf \llbracket Prop_0\rrbracket}$ part of the calculus again by induction.
				Reflexion, of contexts is trivial. For the axiomatic cases, it is a well known result
				that in any Heyting algebra (and thus in $F(HA)$ of any Jcalc algebra) 
				elements of the shape of the axiomatic combinators are equivalent (equiprovable) to $\top$.
				For example in any Heyting algebra  we have $\top\le A^{B^A}$ 
				(using the definition of exponentials twice from the fact $\top\times A\times B\le A$) and as a result 
				$\Gamma^+\leq\phi^{*}$ for any $\Gamma\in {\sf Prop_0}$.
				For the modus ponens rule by the induction hypothesis and the definition of exponentials.
				The interesting part of the proof is the $\Box$ rule which we present again here for readability:
				\begin{mdframed}[nobreak=true, frametitle={\footnotesize Judgments on Necessity with $\Gamma\in {\sf Prop_1} \text{,{\ \sf length}}(\Gamma)=i\text{,\ }
					\ 1\le k\le i  \text{\ and, }\Gamma^{\prime},A, A_k,  B\in {\sf Prop_0}$ }]

					\end{mathpar}}
				\end{mdframed}
				
				By the induction hypothesis we have $(\Gamma^{'})^{+}\le B^{*}$
				and $(\llbracket\Gamma^{'}\rrbracket)^{+}\le FB^{*}$ or equivalently by the properties of $F$
				$F(\Gamma^{'})^{+}+\le F(B^{*})$ which gives $\Box^F{\Gamma^{'}^{+}}\le \Box^F B$
				Additionally from induction hypothesis, for every $A_i$ in $\Gamma^{+}\Box^F A_i$
				and by the product definition $\Gamma^{+}\le\Gamma^{'}^{+}$ and thus
				$\Gamma^{+}\le\Box^F B*$.

				For the inverse we create a Lindenbaum construction. We sketch the construction:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Create a preorder \textit{pre-}$HA$ with underlying set (isomorphic to) ${\sf Prop_0}$
					\item Define $\phi\le\psi$ {\textit{iff}} $\phi\vdash\psi$
					\item Define the equivalce relation $\phi\equiv\psi$ {\textit{iff}} 
					$\phi\le\psi$ and $\psi\le\phi$
					\item Define the quotient \textit{pre-}$HA/_{\equiv}$
					\item Show that it is a Heyting Algebra with products the elements of
					of shape $\phi\wedge\psi$, top $\top$ and exponentials $\phi\supset\psi$
					\item Repeat the construction for the syntactic elements of 
					$\llbracket Prop_0 \rrbracket$, with 
					$\llbracket\phi\rrbracket\le\llbracket\psi\rrbracket$ 
					\textit{iff} $\llbracket\phi\rrbracket\vdash\llbracket\psi\rrbracket$
					show that it is a Heyting algebra $J$.
					\item Repeat the constuction for the syntactic elements of
					 ${\sf Prop_1}$ and $\Box \phi\le\Box\psi$ \textit{iff} $\Box\phi\vdash\Box\psi$
					\item Show that the union of the three relations above forms a 
					Jcalc-algebra with $F:= A\mapsto \llbracket A\rrbracket$. I.e. show that:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item $A\vdash B\Rightarrow \llbracket A\rrbracket\vdash \llbracket B\rrbracket$
						(Holds by the lifting lemma)
						\item $\llbracket A\wedge B\rrbracket $ is product (trivial) and 
						$\llbracket A\supset B \rrbracket$ (trivial given the deduction theorem which we have shown)
						in $J$
						\item $\Box A\vdash\Box B$ \textit{iff} $A\vdash B$ and $\llbracket A\rrbracket \vdash \llbracket A\rrbracket$
						Easy by induction on the derivations and usage of the lifting lemma.
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
				Now assume that $\Gamma^{+}\le\phi*$ for any Jcalc algebra and 
				mapping $*$ and consider  $*$ to extend  the identity mapping  
				into the (free) J-calc algebra defined above. It is easy to see that in JCalc
				$\Gamma\vdash\phi$. E.g. assume, without loss of generality,
				that $\Gamma$ is of the form $\Box\phi_1,\ldots\Box\phi_n$ then
				$\Box\phi_1\wedge\ldots\Box\phi_n\le\phi$ in the free JCalc algebra
				under identity and
				thus $\Box\phi_1\wedge\ldots\Box\phi_n\le\vdash\phi$ by the construction above which
				gives trivially $\Gamma\vdash\phi$ (since $\Gamma\vdash\Box\phi_1\wedge\ldots\Box\phi_n$)
